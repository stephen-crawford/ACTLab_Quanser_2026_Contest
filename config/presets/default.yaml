# Preset: Default (C++ Stack)
#
# Full C++ stack — the current default when launching with `./run_mission.sh`.
# All nodes are C++. No Python fallbacks.
#
# Usage:
#   ./run_mission.sh
#   ./run_mission.sh --mpcc

# --- MPCC parameters (deployment-tuned Feb 2026) ---
# contour=8: intermediate between 4 (too weak, CTE 0.673m) and 15 (too aggressive, swerving)
# lag=15: strong progress to prevent circling
