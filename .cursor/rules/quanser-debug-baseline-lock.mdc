# Quanser Debug Baseline Lock

- For debugging this repo, treat `docs/DEBUG_BASELINE_LOCK.md` as authoritative context.
- Prefer its verified facts over stale references in other markdown files when conflicts appear.
- Do not propose model-equation changes until baseline triage order in that file is exhausted.
- If new evidence conflicts with the baseline, create a candidate-update note first; do not overwrite baseline claims directly.
